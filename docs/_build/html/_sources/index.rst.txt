 Kriging and Gradient-Enhanced Kriging for VKI Lecture Series
==============================================================

Python module implementing interpolation with *Gaussian process regression*, a.k.a. *Kriging*.
Features:

- Arbetrary dimensional interpolation.
- Use of gradients in reconstruction (*Gradient Enhanced Kriging*).
- Simple and univeral Kriging.
- Implementation follows Bayesian derivation of Kriging, descibed in the `tutorial`_.


.. note::

   This code was written for the `Von Karman Institute`_ lecture series on multi-disciplinary
   optimization, and is primarily intended as educational (accompanying the `tutorial`_).
   As such it sacrifices many possible code optimizations to clarity.  If you are planning
   to use it for **applications**, it may still be fast enough, depending on the size of your
   data.  Preferentially use routines in the module :any:`vkikriging.kriging_v2`.

Installing
==========

With git (recommended for educational use)
------------------------------------------
The package is pure Python 3.  To get the source, clone the `GitHub`_ repository::

  git clone https://github.com/rdwight/vkikriging.git

and add `vkikriging` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` (e.g. with ``bash``)::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/fred/vkikriging:$PYTHONPATH

You'll need ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib`` and ``algopy`` (automatic differentiation).
I recommend using an `Anaconda`_ Python install.

.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
  
With pip (recommended for applications)
---------------------------------------
The package is distributed via PyPI, so just use::

  pip install vkikriging

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/rdwight/vkikriging

Usage
=====

Basic usage with plotting (1d)
------------------------------

Using the class :any:`Example1d` you only have to specify a function, its derivative,
the locations of sample points, and parameters for the Kriging/GEK model.  The following
approximates a sine curve on [-5,15] with 5 samples with gradients::

  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from examples.example1d import Example1d

  # 1. Initialize the function to approxiate, samples and Kriging paramters
  ex1d = Example1d(np.sin, np.cos,
                   np.linspace(0, 10, 5),
                   gamma=1.0, sigma_d=0.001, sigma_dg=0.01,
                   xi_min=-5, xi_max=15)
		   
  # 2. Build the Kriging model, v1, v2 or v3.  For v1, v2 GEK model is also built.
  ex1d.build_surrogate_v1()
  
  # 3. Plot the model, use any of all of the plot_* functions
  fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
  ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
  ex1d.plot_gek(ax)
  ex1d.plot_posterior_samples_gek(ax)
  ex1d.plot_reference(ax)
  ex1d.plot_observed_gradients(ax, length=1.)
  plt.show()

Some timing information is printed to ``stdout``, and the following figure is plotted:

.. image:: Figure_1.png
	   
The black curve is the exact function, black circles and lines are samples of the function
and its derivative.  The heavy blue line is the GEK mean, with 1,2,3-standard-deviation
regions in light blue.  The thin blue lines are 10 independent samples from the
predictive distribution.

Basic usage with plotting (2d)
------------------------------

To achieve basic interpolation in 2d use the class :any:`Example2d`.  This expects an
object describing the function, with attributes ``f``, ``df``, ``xmin``, ``xmax``,
and ``xopt``.  See examples in :any:`vkikriging.test_functions`.  To approximate a
parabola with Sobol samples::

  from vkikriging.test_functions import Parabola
  from vkikriging.sampling import sobol
  from examples.example2d import Example2d

  # 1. Initialize the function to approxiate, samples and Kriging paramters
  f = Parabola()
  xi = sobol(4, 2) * (f.xmax - f.xmin) + f.xmin
  ex2d = Example2d(f, xi, gamma=1., sigma_d=0.01, sigma_dg=0.01)

  # 2. Build the Kriging model, v1, v2 or v3.  For v1, v2 GEK model is also built.
  ex2d.build_surrogate_v1()

  # 3. Plot the model
  ex2d.plot_contours()

Which produces the following figure:
  
.. image:: Figure_2.png
	   
The red circle is the exact minimum, and the crosses are the minima approximated by Kriging/GEK.
